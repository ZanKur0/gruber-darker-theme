# Gruber Darker #

[Gruber Darker](http://jblevins.org/projects/emacs-color-themes/color-theme-gruber-darker.el.html)
color theme for Emacs by Jason Blevins. A darker variant of the
[Gruber Dark](http://daringfireball.net/projects/bbcolors/schemes/)
theme for BBEdit by John Gruber. Adapted for deftheme and extended by
Alexey Kutepov a.k.a. rexim.

Adaptation to Visual Studio Code by Alex a.k.a Zankur0

# Note #

This maybe look different to the original gruber darker by rexim. I did my own approach. Feel free to modify it.
This **only** works in the lenguages what syntax-highlighter can support.

I can't find a proper way to change the `this`. If you know how to do it open a pull request.

# Installation #

1. Install [syntax-highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evgeniypeshkov.syntax-highlighter).
2. Copy or move the contents of [`settings.json`](https://github.com/ZanKur0/gruber-darker-theme/blob/master/settings.json) into your `settings.json`.
3. ???
4. Profit.

# Contribution #

Gruber Darker is an awesome theme. But it has a lack of support for
many good modes. I add color faces only for modes I use. If you like
this theme and use a mode that looks very bad with it, feel free to
add appropriate color faces (see file gruber-darker-theme.el) and send
me a pull request.

Thanks.
