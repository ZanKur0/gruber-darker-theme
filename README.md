# Gruber Darker #

[Gruber Darker](http://jblevins.org/projects/emacs-color-themes/color-theme-gruber-darker.el.html)
color theme for Emacs by Jason Blevins. A darker variant of the
[Gruber Dark](http://daringfireball.net/projects/bbcolors/schemes/)
theme for BBEdit by John Gruber. Adapted for deftheme and extended by
Alexey Kutepov a.k.a. rexim.

Adaptation to Visual Studio Code by Alex a.k.a Zankur0

# Note #

This maybe look different to the original gruber darker by rexim. I did my own approach. Feel free to modify it.
This **only** works in the lenguages what syntax-highlighter can support.

# Customization #

You can add custom textMate Rules.

1. Open [Scope Inspector](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#scope-inspector).
2. Copy the `scope`.
3. Make your configuration like [this](https://github.com/ZanKur0/gruber-darker-theme/blob/5ca345c9a029a5ff1fb34f3c6f9275216b502743/settings.json#L71)

# Contribution #

Gruber Darker is an awesome theme. But it has a lack of support for
many good modes. I add color faces only for modes I use. If you like
this theme and use a mode that looks very bad with it, feel free to
add appropriate color faces (see file gruber-darker-theme.el) and send
me a pull request.

Thanks.
