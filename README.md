# Note #

This maybe look different to the original gruber darker by rexim. I did my own approach. Feel free to modify it.

# Contribution #

Gruber Darker is an awesome theme. But it has a lack of support for
many good modes. I add color faces only for modes I use. If you like
this theme and use a mode that looks very bad with it, feel free to
add appropriate color faces (see file gruber-darker-theme.el) and send
me a pull request.

Thanks.
